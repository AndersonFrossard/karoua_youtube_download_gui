	<h2>Download youtube videos</h2>

	<p>Hi.</p>
	<p>There are many youtube downloaders scattered around the web.
	 Many of them non-functional or have lots of garbage  such  as 
	 ads, malwares, anoying messages and so on.

	My software is straight to the point:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Insert youtube link</li>
	  <li>Choose resolution</li>
	  <li>Download</li>
	</ul>      

	This version has a GUI interface but it also runs on CLI.

	<h2>Running with GUI interface:</h2>
	<p>python youtube_download.py</>
	<br>
	![image01]("./img/image01.png")
	<h2>Running with CLI interface:</h2>
	<p>python youtube_download.py --nogui</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	Enjoy!
