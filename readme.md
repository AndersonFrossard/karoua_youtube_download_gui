## About

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>There are many youtube downloaders scattered around the web.
 Many of them non-functional or have lots of garbage  such  as 
 ads, malwares, anoying messages and so on.

My software is straight to the point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insert youtube link</li>
  <li>Choose resolution</li>
  <li>Download</li>
</ul>      

## Features
- [X] Gui Interface
- [x] Download video
- [x] Download audio
- [ ] Download full-playlist

## Instalation-and-how-to-use


### Requirements

>pytube 11.0.2 or greater

	pip install pytube


## GUI - Graphical User Interface

	python youtube_download.py

![GUI interface](./img/image01.png)

## CLI - Command Line Interface

<h2>Running with CLI :</h2>

	python youtube_download.py --nogui

![CLI interface](./img/image02.png)

## Standalone
## Standalone executable for Windows:

Perhaps you just want a fast way to get things running. The standalone executable will suit you well.
<ul>
	<li>Download the zip file</li>
	<li>Check  integrity of zip file's content (optional)</li>
	<li>Unzip the zip file into a new folder</li>
	<li>Check CRC of its content (optional)
	<li>Double click on youtube_download.exe </li>
</ul>

### How to check whether the zipfile has not been tampered with:

First, you need to download my pgp public key and check if my public key has not been hacked or tampered with. In order to do that, you should download my public pgp key from two different sources.
They must have the same fingerprint and must not have been revoked.

[Check my Fingerprint here](#fingerprint)

### How to obtain my Public keys

[Public key](#public-key)


### How to check if the keys are correct and valid:

 Run this command to check fingerprint from diferent files:

	gpg --show-keys filename1.asc
 
 ![Checking fingerprints](./img/image04.png)
 
 If they both have my [fingerprint](#fingerprint) and have not been revoked, good, the key is valid and secure for use. 

Import my pgp public signature key:

	gpg --import frossard.public.key.asc

Check wether youtube_download.zip has been signed by myself:

	gpg --verify youtube_download.sig

To pass verification you should see a message saying
>Good signature from Anderson Frossard. (Das ist meine key. Wir ziehen voran!)

gpg will probably also say this signature is not certified. That¬¥s because you have just downloaded it and have not applied command *trust* to it.

Once the gpg has verified the zip file and been signed by myself, you are safe to unzip it and run its executable.

If you want additional step of safety, you can verify the crc.txt file and check wether the hash of downloaded zip file meet the hash indicated in crc.txt file. Here it is:

	gpg --verify crc.txt.sig

Once sucessfully verified, you are good to hash your downloaded zip file and compare with contents from crc.txt.
The hash should be exactly the same. You are safe to unzip and run the executable. 
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>SHA-256</td>
		<td>File</td>
	<tr>
		<td>1446056F904BCC639CB844611F69E8218FCE32AB3314E00F676BF80FE659061B</td>
		<td>youtube_download.zip</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Public-key

My PGP public key is avaiable at:

### Fingerprint
My PGP public key full fingerprint is:

	921D 2E99 8D1E 3213 DFCF 74F7 B79A AE88 46C1 8DF7
