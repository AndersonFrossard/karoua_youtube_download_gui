# Karoua Youtube Download

<h2>Download youtube videos</h2>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>There are many youtube downloaders scattered around the web.
 Many of them non-functional or have lots of garbage  such  as 
 ads, malwares, anoying messages and so on.

My software is straight to the point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insert youtube link</li>
  <li>Choose resolution</li>
  <li>Download</li>
</ul>      

This version has a GUI interface but it also runs on CLI.

<h2>Running with GUI interfacellllppooobbaa:</h2>

	python youtube_download.py

Enjoy!
